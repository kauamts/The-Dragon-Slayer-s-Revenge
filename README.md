> THE DRAGON SLAYER'S REVENGE

DSR is a narrative-driven text RPG game made in C# for Windows Console.

The game was created in 2010 by four Vancouver Film School's GD18 students as a part of VFS' Game Design Program.
Being the first C# game made by the creators, the project was meant to be just a test to their new found knowledge,
but ended up being much more then that. The game is rich with old-school RPG references and it's short narrative
manages to immerse the player, putting him/her in the shoes of the Dragon Slayer, even if just for a short while.
This game was made in less then one work week and is a testment to how far the love for one's craft can take them.
